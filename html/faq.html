                <h3 style="max-width:600px">Does this website make me a doctor?</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">No, this website does not offer medical degrees.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 style="max-width:600px">Where is the data taken from?</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">The website uses the RxNorm API from the Department of Health and Human Services at the National Institute of Medicine (NLM).</p>
                <br>

                <h3 style="max-width:600px">Will there be future updates to the website?</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">Yes, I plan on adding the option to delete any specific medication in the list. Additionally, there will be an option to search drug prices and see the US drug prices compared to other countries.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 style="max-width:600px">Is this information that I, the patient, am allowed to see?</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">Yes, I did not include any information that a doctor wouldn't disclose to their patients. I also consulted with several doctors/medical students to ensure that they are comfortable with the provided information.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 style="max-width:600px">I don't understand the interactions of the drug.</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">If you have any concerns with the medications you are taking, discuss them with your doctor. This website is only meant to educate the patient of their medications. Hence, why the website does not include follow-up actions.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 style="max-width:600px">Can you look at this mole I have on me?</h3>
                <p style="max-width:600px">No.</p>
